## Description

The following challenge tested our skills as developers by creating a quiz with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The starting page contains a start button that once clicked will begin a quiz setting off a timer. A new screen containing a series of multiple choice questions will appear. If the answer is incorrect 10 seconds will be deducted from the amount of time left. After completing the quiz a score will be displayed that will allow the user to submit their score and retry the quiz again after viewing their submission.
